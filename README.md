G-Star-Demo
===========

Super early demonstration of my work-in-progress game using LUA and C++ with Love2D Game Engine/Library

If you want to check the source code of the game, simple rename the G-STARS.exe to G-STARS.zip then extract the contents.

It is written in Lua with LOVE2D as it's main game library/engine that is created in C++

This project was started a week ago. I will be updating this every week.
